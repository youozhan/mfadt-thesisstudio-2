#### Science Fair Engagement Plan
*What to show at the science fair?*
* Mockups of two proposals
* Mockup of the digital profile based on the google account
* Mockup of the physical visualization

*What information (text/visual) will be considered as a brief of the project?*
* Short description: *Inside the Box* is looking at how the algorithm-controlled system is affecting the everyday lives and what are the current public reactions responding to this problem. 
* Examples of receipt
* The content of the visualization

*What are the key questions?*
* What would drive the visitor to engage with the interactive installation?
* What is the key information that will constitute the physical visualization? 

*What feedback/content am I gathering?*
* Screenshots of the screentime from all participants
* How well do the participants perceive the information?

#### Proposal 1

When the visitor comes to the space, he/she will see multiple IoT printers mounted to the wall. The visitor can use the phone to connect to a local web server. During the connecting process, the visitor will need to authorize the web server to use his/her google account. A digital profile will be created based on this account. The information will be provided in three aspects: monetizing content, userâ€™s attention and focus, and group impact. The server will then send the information to one of the IoT printers. 

#### Proposal 2

When the visitor comes to the space, he/she will see one IoT printer and a physical visualization. The visitor can use the IoT printer and his/her Google account to contribute to the physical visualization. 

#### Research Focus
* The story of auto-play
* Default, cache, server
* History of YouTube
* YouTube meta information
