#### Post-review reflection
Main feedback received:

MC - Amazing - so much information. Super interesting thesis, you’re in a good place. Pause: what is your algorithm saying? Visual mechanisms are great, but need to fine-tune and re-think the message. What are you saying in this piece? How much are my eyeballs worth? What is the unit of value? What are you trying to show (in two sentences)? **You are raw material.** So much of this is unknown to us. Are you trying to show the wall of the unknown? We don’t know how much Google is making off any one person. You’re at a point where you can experiment: **poetry not demo.** What is the poetic aspect of this? Do the receipts reveal what we suspect?

UM - Super relevant topic. TED talk by James Bridle: YouTube and Kids, monetizing. Agree with Melanie, think about the take-away. Highlight this important issue. What happens when people get paid for this labor? **How are the comments working in YouTube?**

Changes based on the user test:

Methods of data collection - The method of data collection has been changed from collecting with user's phone and having the user to review the setting on the phone, to using larger screen and using chrome extension. This would better integrate with the pre-data-collecting process.

Receipt as the form - Receipt would not simply appear at the exhibition. It became the acknowledgement of the output of this algorithmic process. It went digital. The physical form will be used as a connection and be emphasized during the exhiition.

Two different identities - There is no need to categorize one person as one side of the content pulishing workflow. We can all have two identities, and it should be presented within one form.

Reflection on the feedback:
* How to emphasize the poetic factor of this project?
* How to better reflect the "raw material" in the process?
* Key algorithmic components - YouTube recommendation algorithm, the story of autoplay, monetizing the contents.
* Is there a narrative can connect these components better?
